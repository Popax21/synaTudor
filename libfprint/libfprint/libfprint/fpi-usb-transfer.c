 *
 * #FpiUsbTransfer is a structure to simplify the USB transfer handling.
 * The main goal is to ease memory management and provide more parameters
 * to callbacks that are useful for libfprint drivers.
 *
 * Drivers should use this API only rather than accessing the GUsbDevice
 * directly in most cases.
