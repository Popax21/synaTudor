LIBRARY
=======
test suite against NFIQ compliance set
make library optionally asynchronous and maybe thread-safe
nbis cleanups
API function to determine if img device supports uncond. capture
race-free way of saying "save this print but don't overwrite"

NEW DRIVERS
===========
Sunplus 895 driver
AES3400/3500 driver
ID Mouse driver
Support for 2nd generation MS devices
Support for 2nd generation UPEK devices

IMAGING
=======
ignore first frame or two with aes2501
aes2501: increase threshold "sum" for end-of-image detection
aes2501 gain calibration
aes4000 gain calibration
aes4000 resampling
PPMM parameter to get_minutiae seems to have no effect
nbis minutiae should be stored in endian-independent format

PORTABILITY
===========
OpenBSD can't do -Wshadow or visibility
OpenBSD: add compat codes for ENOTSUP ENODATA and EPROTO
