This file lists notable changes in each release. For the full history of all
changes, see ChangeLog.

2020-12-01: v1.90.7 release

Highlights:
 * vfs5011: Fix possible use-after-free
 * goodixmoc: Add two new PIDs (0x63AC, 0x639C)
 * goodixmoc: Support finger status API
 * synaptics: Only identify within provided prints
 * synaptics: Reject devices with old firmware during probe (#239)


2020-12-01: v1.90.6 release

This release is primarily a bugfix release for some older issues.

The major change is that fp_print_deserialize will now correctly return a
sunken reference rather than a floating one. Most API users will have
assumed this was true, and issues could happen at a later point.
If any API user worked around this libfprint bug, they will now leak the
returned print.

Highlights:
 * Object reference management fixes for FpPrint and identify
 * Fixed issues that caused problem on non-x86 machines (#236)
 * Fix building with older GLib versions
 * synaptics: Support PID 00e7
 * goodix: Fix issue with long USB packages


2020-12-01: v1.90.5 release

The 1.90.4 release caused a major regression, as it included a USB hub in
UDEV the autosupend rule list.

Highlights:
 * Remove USB hub from udev autosupend rules
 * synaptics: Add PID 0x00c9 which is used in some HP laptops


2020-11-27: v1.90.4 release

This release contains a number of important bugfixes. On the feature side,
the USB hotplug support was improved. A lot of drivers received fixes and
improvements.

Highlights:
 * Work around GUsb cancellation issue
 * Redefine internal image device state machine for more robustness
 * Add public finger-status reporting to FpDevice
 * Rework device removal API to be convenient (#330)
 * Enable powersave for unsupported USB devices
 * Improvements to examples
 * synaptics: Support identify operation
 * synaptics: Fix possible crash when the interrupt transfer is resubmitted
 * synaptics: Add support for PIDs 0x00f9, 0x00fc and 0x00c2
 * elan: Add PID 0x0c4d to supported device list
 * aes3k: Fix driver and add CI test (#306)
 * uru4000: Fix reference counting of image transfer
 * vfs301: Fix driver and add CI test (#320)

2020-06-08: v1.90.3 release

This release mostly contains support for a number of new match-on-chip
devices. Most notable is the addition of the new goodixmoc driver.
Currently the driver has the small caveat that we have no strategy to
garbage collect old prints yet (a simple strategy could be implemented
in fprintd).

Highlights:
 * New goodixmoc driver supporting Goodix USB devices:
   27C6:5840
   27C6:6496
   27C6:60A2
 * Newly added support for Synaptics device:
   06CB:00E9
   06CB:00DF
 * Fixed an issue with Synaptics devices sometimes not working at boot
 * Fix issue with aes3k driver (#306)

2020-06-08: v1.90.2 release

This release contains a large amount of bug and regression fixes. These
are not listed explicitly, but affect the majority of drivers.

Highlights:
 * A patch for nbis required for some sensors was accidentally dropped in
   an earlier release. Users of these sensors/drivers (aes1610, aes2501,
   aes2550, aes1660, aes2660, elan, upektc_img) need to re-enroll (#142).

2019-11-20: v1.90.1 release

This release fixes a lot of the regressions introduced in 1.90.0. Please note
that both the driver and external APIs have changed, as both the verify and
the identify functions now have early reporting mechanisms.
The soname for the library, as well as a number of file locations have also
changed. While this allows installation in parallel with the 1.0 version of
libfprint, we recommend installing only one, and migrating from version 1.0 to
version 2.0 alongside its main consumer (fprintd).

Only major changes are listed below. A lot of other cleanup work and small
fixes have also been merged.

* Library:
  - Add support to run tests in gdb/valgrind
  - Allow testing on all architectures
  - Avoid image device AWAIT_FINGER_ON to deactivate state transitions
  - Fix verify/identify error propagation to library user
  - Correctly read image device information from class data
  - Continue enroll after an image driver reported a retry error
  - Change external API to allow reporting match results early
  - A lot of new unit tests and integration tests have been added

* Drivers API
  - Support variadic arguments in error functions
  - Various re-definitions of ownership handling
  - Add convenience API to change state after a timeout
  - Add unit tests for all the drivers API

* Drivers:
  - elan: Ensure correct deactivation of device
  - uru4000: Fix IRQ handler registration and internal state handling
  - uru4000: Fix control transfer request type
  - synaptics: Ensure errors are only reported after finger removal

2019-11-20: v1.90.0 release

This release updates the core of the library to use GLib routines and Gio
style APIs. While the API both for library users remain similar in most
ways, there are some changes and all users will need to be ported.

A large motivation for the in-depth changes was the requirement to add
new API to support sensors that store the prints on the sensor. This
support is already used by the new synaptics driver, which will support
the current generation of the Prometheus MIS (match-in-sensor) chipset
by Synaptics (USB ID 06cb:00bd).

The current codebase is considered stable at this point. However, due to
the lack of wider testing it is only released as a 1.90.0 release which
can be considered a beta-release for 2.0.

With the rewrite, it is now also possible to support devices that are not
connected through USB (e.g. I2C). Another major improvement is that the
library has now a test suite, testing both the library core and allowing
tests of the drivers using umockdev.

2019-08-08: v1.0 release
* Library:
  - Add guards to the public API and require GLib 2.50
  - Deprecate print storage API
  - Better documentation for fp_discover_devs()
  - Remove unused internal fpi_timeout_cancel_for_dev()
  - Remove state from fp_img_driver activate handler
  - Bug fixes related to restarting a failed verification immediately

* Drivers:
  - The Elan driver received a lot of bug fixes including a fix for a
    hang when verifying prints with fprintd, quirks for some devices,
    a memory leak fix and support for 04f3:0c42
  - Fix a probable crash in all the AES drivers
  - Add support for Lenovo Preferred Pro Keyboard (KUF1256) to vfs5011
  - Prevent hang during enroll process in etes603 driver
  - Fix possible integer overflow in uru4000
  - Work-around SELinux AVC warnings when uru4000 driver starts
  - Remove long-unmaintained and broken fdu2000 driver

* Tools/Examples:
  - Fix examples not working due to an overly strict check
  - Fix crash in GTK demo when there's no supported devices
  - Disable GTK demo until we have a USB Flatpak portal
  - Remove sleep() in enroll example which caused a crash in some drivers
  - Add a simple storage implementation example

2018-12-14: v0.99.0 release
* Library:
  - All the internal API for device driver writers is now covered by the
    documentation and has been enhanced to make it easier to write drivers
  - Update internal NBIS fingerprint data processing library to one that's
    nearly 10 years newer
  - Re-add accessor for minutia coordinates which was used in the very
    old fprint_demo program, but also by our new GTK+ test program (see below)
  - Fix a crash when too many minutiae were detected in a capture

* Drivers:
  - Support more devices in the Elan driver, stability improvements

* Tools:
  - Add a test GTK+ application that will eventually be used for testing
    drivers without modifying the OS installed version. Note that this
    application currently requires manually changing permissions of USB
    devices, this will be fixed when the infrastructure exists to access
    those devices without additional permissions, as a normal user.

    be visible warnings, hopefully helping with fixing them.
